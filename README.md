# Check

## An app used to check in with friends and family.

This is a learning project. A good deal of the code was created alongside Reed Barger's Udemy course. Sometimes the code was used as a starting point, sometimes the code was copied exactly when I got stuck and couldn't find a way out of the problem.

This project will be changed completely as I learn more about the Flutter framework and am able to build my own solutions.

For now, thanks goes to [Reed Barger's Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-social-network-with-flutter-and-firebase).
